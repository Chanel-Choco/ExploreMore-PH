# Login Debug and Fix Guide

## Major Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Database Query Syntax Issue (CRITICAL)**

- **Problem**: Using MySQL syntax (`?` placeholders) with PostgreSQL database
- **Fix**: Changed all query placeholders from `?` to `$1, $2, $3...`
- **Changed**:
  - Login route: `WHERE email = ?` â†’ `WHERE email = $1`
  - Signup route: All `?` â†’ `$1, $2, $3, $4`
  - Result access: `results.length` â†’ `results.rows.length`
  - Result data: `results[0]` â†’ `results.rows[0]`

### 2. **CORS Configuration Fix**

- **Problem**: Trailing slash in origin URL
- **Fix**: Removed trailing slash from `https://exploremore-rouge.vercel.app/`

### 3. **Added Debug Endpoints**

- Added `/api/test` endpoint to test server connectivity
- Enhanced frontend logging to test connection before login

## Debugging Steps:

### Step 1: Test Server Connectivity

1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Try to login and check the console logs
4. Look for:
   - ðŸ§ª Test response messages
   - ðŸ“¡ Response status and data
   - Any CORS errors

### Step 2: Check Railway Logs

1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click on the latest deployment
5. Check the logs for:
   - Database connection messages
   - Any error messages during login attempts

### Step 3: Environment Variables Check

Make sure these are set in Railway:

```
POSTGRES_URL=your_postgres_connection_string
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING=your_non_pooling_string
SESSION_SECRET=your_secret_key
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Common Error Solutions:

### If you see "CORS error":

- Update the CORS origin in server.js to match your exact Vercel URL
- Make sure no trailing slashes

### If you see "Database connection error":

- Check your POSTGRES_URL environment variables in Railway
- Make sure the database is accessible

### If you see "Network error":

- Check that your Railway URL is correct in auth.js
- Make sure Railway service is running

### If login appears to work but sessions don't persist:

- Check SESSION_SECRET is set in Railway
- Verify cookie settings for cross-origin

## Next Steps:

1. **Deploy these changes to Railway**
2. **Test the `/api/test` endpoint** by visiting: `https://exploremore-production-c375.up.railway.app/api/test`
3. **Try login again** and check browser console for detailed logs
4. **Check Railway logs** for any server-side errors

## If still not working:

Please share:

1. **Browser console logs** when trying to login
2. **Railway server logs** during login attempt
3. **Exact error message** you're seeing
4. **Your actual Vercel URL** (to verify CORS configuration)
